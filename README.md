# Boiler Control System

Boiler control system with Arduino.
The system based on the Arduino Uno board, but you can use another model. The system uses a 16x2 LCD display and real-time clock based on the DS3231.

The unit is designed to control a common boiler, multiple temperature zones. And control various plants.

By applying some intelligence in control, we save energy and pay less electricity bill.

System connections are solid state relays, to facilitate the assembly of each thermostat and boiler unit.

It has used cheap components and easy to find.

Provision is made for mounting four thermostats and four solenoid valves, although this can be adjusted.

It is assumed that you have a boiler and four solenoid circuit already mounted.
